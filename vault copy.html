<h3 class="text-white">How does this work?</h3>
<p>Arcadium Vault offers a Smart Contract Interface which allows you to create Time-locked Wallet Contracts - so, you can create a &quot;Lockbox&quot; that only opens for a particular address at a certain date and time! What's better, is you can choose the address which can open the wallet and receive its contents - deposit anytime, open only when it&apos;s time!</p>

<h3 class="text-white">Can I withdraw from the Wallet before time is reached?</h3>
<p>No. We would advise not even trying.</p>

<h3 class="text-white">Can I add to the wallet balance before time is reached?</h3>
<p>You can add ETC to the wallet balance at ANY time!</p>
