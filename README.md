# Flux Platform

## Introduction
Flux Platform is a collaborative effort website and framework built upon several projects, merged into one codebase. Started from the creation of a customised Pure interface for the Commonwealth.gg Smart Contract, Flux Platform has grown to host several Dapps and games which all provide benefit to those who hold Points.

## How it Works
Flux Platform is live and accessible at https://flux.arcadium.network - this will show the homepage (in this repo, index.html)
The following URLs are also accessible:
 - https://flux.arcadium.network/broadcast.html
 - https://flux.arcadium.network/flux.html
 - https://flux.arcadium.network/powerinc.html
 - https://flux.arcadium.network/racearena.html
 - https://flux.arcadium.network/vault.html
 
You will need to access the website via a Dapp Browser, or a browser with a Web3 wallet (such as Saturn Wallet, available for Chrome and Firefox) to load all features properly. To participate in most functions offered by the Dapps and games, you will need Ethereum Classic (ETC) in your wallet, and in some cases you may also need Points (which one can buy via https://flux.arcadium.network/flux.html, or https://commonwealth.gg/pure.html).
 
## Host your Own
If you would like to host your own copy of the Flux Platform, FEEL FREE! there are only a few simple instructions you must follow to properly prepare - listed below for convenience!

1. Fork this Repo
2. Delete CNAME
3. Change the Masternode Address (optional)
 - The masternode address is by default set to the wallet of the first developer of Flux - Deano.
 - If you change it to your wallet address, you will collect 3 of 10% buy/sell fees ( in the flux.html interface).
4. Go to the settings of your forked copy of Flux Platform
5. Enable Github Pages on the Master branch
6. Add your own domain (optional)

## Contribute
If you'd like to add something, feel free to create a fork, make your changes/updates/whatevers, and create a pull request! The core Arcadium Network developer team will review it and implement it should it provide benefit to those who hold Points, from the Commonwealth.gg Contract.
